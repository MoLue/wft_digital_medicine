Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period of time. Symptoms often include frequent urination, increased thirst and increased appetite. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many health complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment.

    Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin due to loss of beta cells. This form was previously referred to as "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" or "juvenile diabetes". The loss of beta cells is caused by an autoimmune response. The cause of this autoimmune response is unknown.

    Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses, a lack of insulin may also develop. This form was previously referred to as "non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" or "adult-onset diabetes". The most common cause is a combination of excessive body weight and insufficient exercise.

    Prevention and treatment involve maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical exercise, a normal body weight, and avoiding use of tobacco. Control of blood pressure and maintaining proper foot and eye care are important for people with the disease. Type 1 diabetes must be managed with insulin injections. Type 2 diabetes may be treated with medications with or without insulin. Insulin and some oral medications can cause low blood sugar. Weight loss surgery in those with obesity is sometimes an effective measure in those with type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after the birth of the baby.

    Recent advances in diabetes care include the development of closed-loop insulin delivery systems, also known as artificial pancreas technology. These systems combine continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with insulin pumps and algorithms that automatically adjust insulin delivery based on real-time glucose levels. The first hybrid closed-loop system was approved by the FDA in 2016, with subsequent generations offering increasingly automated control. These technologies have significantly improved glycemic control and reduced the burden of disease management for people with type 1 diabetes.

    Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has evolved rapidly, with modern sensors offering improved accuracy, longer wear times (up to 14 days), and compatibility with smartphones. CGM systems provide real-time glucose readings and trend information, allowing for more proactive management and earlier intervention to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia. Studies have shown that CGM use is associated with improved glycemic control in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

    Novel medications for type 2 diabetes include GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide, dulaglutide, and tirzepatide) and SGLT2 inhibitors (such as empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin). These medications not only improve glycemic control but also offer cardiovascular and renal benefits independent of their glucose-lowering effects. GLP-1 receptor agonists promote weight loss and have been approved at higher doses specifically for obesity treatment. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and progression of kidney disease, leading to their use even in non-diabetic patients with these conditions.

    Emerging research in type 1 diabetes includes immunotherapy approaches aimed at preserving beta cell function in newly diagnosed patients, as well as cell-based therapies using stem cells to generate insulin-producing cells. For type 2 diabetes, there is increasing focus on precision medicine approaches that tailor treatment based on individual characteristics, including genetic factors, to optimize outcomes. The role of the gut microbiome in diabetes pathogenesis and management is also an active area of investigation.
