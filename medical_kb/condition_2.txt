Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure typically does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.

    High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol use. The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure, defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.

    Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. For most adults, normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–130 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–80 mmHg diastolic. For most adults, high blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/80 or 140/90 mmHg. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office-based blood pressure measurement.

    Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications. Lifestyle changes include weight loss, physical exercise, decreased salt intake, reducing alcohol intake, and a healthy diet. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient, then blood pressure medications are used. Several medications are effective for treating hypertension.

    Recent hypertension guidelines from major organizations such as the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) have redefined blood pressure categories and treatment thresholds. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines lowered the threshold for hypertension diagnosis to 130/80 mmHg from the previous 140/90 mmHg, significantly increasing the number of adults classified as having hypertension. The 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines maintained the 140/90 mmHg threshold but recommended lower treatment targets, especially for high-risk patients.

    The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet has been extensively studied and proven effective for blood pressure reduction. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products while limiting sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars. The DASH diet can lower systolic blood pressure by 8-14 mmHg, comparable to the effect of some antihypertensive medications. Sodium restriction to less than 2,300 mg per day (and ideally less than 1,500 mg for those with hypertension) can further reduce blood pressure by 2-8 mmHg.

    First-line pharmacological treatments for hypertension typically include thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The choice among these depends on patient characteristics such as age, race, comorbidities, and potential side effects. Combination therapy is often required to achieve blood pressure targets, with fixed-dose combinations improving adherence. Recent evidence supports initial combination therapy rather than sequential monotherapy for patients with stage 2 hypertension or high cardiovascular risk.

    Resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes (including a diuretic) at optimal doses, affects approximately 10-15% of hypertensive patients. Management approaches include ruling out secondary causes, addressing medication adherence, optimizing lifestyle modifications, and considering additional agents such as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone). Device-based interventions such as renal denervation and baroreflex activation therapy are being investigated for resistant hypertension, with mixed results in clinical trials.

    Emerging research in hypertension includes precision medicine approaches that use genetic, molecular, and clinical characteristics to guide treatment selection. The role of the gut microbiome in blood pressure regulation is also being explored, with evidence suggesting that alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolites may contribute to hypertension pathogenesis. Novel therapeutic targets under investigation include endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation pathways.
