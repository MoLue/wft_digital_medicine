Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.

    Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.

    There is no cure for asthma. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.

    In 2019, 262 million people globally had asthma, up from 183 million in 1990. It caused about 455,000 deaths in 2019, most of which occurred in the developing world. Asthma often begins in childhood, and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s. Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt. The word "asthma" is from the Greek ἆσθμα, meaning "panting".

    Modern understanding of asthma has evolved to recognize it as a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes and endotypes, rather than a single condition. Major phenotypes include allergic asthma (most common in children), non-allergic asthma, late-onset asthma, asthma with fixed airflow limitation, and asthma with obesity. Each phenotype may have distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (endotypes), which has important implications for treatment approaches. The most well-characterized endotype is type 2 (T2) inflammation, characterized by elevated levels of interleukins IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and often associated with allergic asthma.

    The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, updated regularly, provide a stepwise approach to asthma management based on symptom control and risk factors. A significant change in recent guidelines is the recommendation against SABA (short-acting beta agonists) monotherapy, even for mild asthma, due to safety concerns. Instead, all adults and adolescents with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations.

    For patients with severe asthma (approximately 5-10% of all asthma patients) who remain uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS plus LABA, biologic therapies targeting specific inflammatory pathways have revolutionized treatment. These include anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab) for allergic asthma, anti-IL-5/IL-5R therapies (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) for eosinophilic asthma, and anti-IL-4R therapy (dupilumab) which blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. These biologics have demonstrated efficacy in reducing exacerbations, improving lung function, and reducing oral corticosteroid use in appropriate patients.

    Digital health technologies are increasingly being incorporated into asthma management. Smart inhalers with sensors can track medication use and technique, while mobile applications can help monitor symptoms, triggers, and medication adherence. Machine learning algorithms applied to these data, along with electronic health records and environmental information, show promise for predicting exacerbations and personalizing treatment.

    Emerging research areas include the role of the microbiome in asthma development and exacerbations, with evidence suggesting that early-life dysbiosis may contribute to asthma pathogenesis. Novel therapeutic approaches under investigation include TSLP inhibitors (tezepelumab), CRTh2 antagonists, and bronchial thermoplasty for selected patients with severe asthma. Prevention strategies focus on early-life interventions, with studies suggesting that exposure to diverse environmental microbes, particularly in farm environments, may protect against asthma development.
