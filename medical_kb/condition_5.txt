Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.

    The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. There are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development. The strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of APOE. Other risk factors include a history of head injury, clinical depression, and high blood pressure. The disease process is largely associated with amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neuronal connections in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal aging. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis, but this can only be done after death. Good nutrition, physical exercise, and social engagement are known to be of benefit generally in aging, and these may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's; in 2019, clinical trials were underway to look at these possibilities. There are no medications or supplements that have been shown to decrease risk.

    No treatments stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a burden on the caregiver. The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes. Behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are often treated with antipsychotics, but this is not usually recommended, as there is little benefit and an increased risk of early death.

    Recent research has identified several biomarkers that may help in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms appear. These include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers such as decreased amyloid-β42 and increased tau and phosphorylated tau, as well as neuroimaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) scans that can detect amyloid and tau deposits in the brain. Blood-based biomarkers are also being developed, which could provide less invasive diagnostic options.

    The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's involves several mechanisms beyond amyloid and tau pathology, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and vascular factors. This has led to the development of multi-target therapeutic approaches. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has dominated research for decades, suggesting that the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides initiates a sequence of events leading to neurodegeneration.

    In 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to aducanumab (Aduhelm), the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's that targets amyloid plaques. This was followed by lecanemab (Leqembi) in 2023, which also targets amyloid. However, these treatments remain controversial due to modest clinical benefits, potential side effects including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), and high costs. Other disease-modifying approaches in development include tau-targeting therapies, anti-inflammatory agents, and neuroprotective compounds.

    Current symptomatic treatments include cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine, which may temporarily improve cognitive symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive stimulation therapy, reminiscence therapy, and music therapy have shown benefits for quality of life and behavioral symptoms.

    Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis through the analysis of complex patterns in neuroimaging, speech, and digital biomarkers. These technologies may also help predict disease progression and treatment response, potentially enabling more personalized approaches to management.
