Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), or simply heart disease, involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to build-up of plaque (atherosclerosis) in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases. Types include stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and improve with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. In many cases, the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat.

    Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, and excessive alcohol. A number of tests may help with diagnoses including: electrocardiogram, cardiac stress testing, coronary computed tomographic angiography, and coronary angiogram, among others.

    Prevention is by eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking. Sometimes medication for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are also used. There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms. Treatment involves the same measures as prevention. Additional medications such as antiplatelets (including aspirin), beta blockers, or nitroglycerin may be recommended. Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery may be used in severe disease. In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improves life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk.

    Modern diagnostic approaches for CAD have evolved significantly in recent years. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a non-invasive alternative to invasive coronary angiography for many patients, with high sensitivity for detecting coronary stenosis. Advanced CCTA techniques such as CT fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and CT perfusion imaging provide functional assessment of stenosis severity, helping to determine which lesions are causing ischemia and require intervention. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) offers comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure, function, perfusion, and viability without radiation exposure, making it particularly valuable for younger patients or those requiring serial imaging.

    Positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging provides superior diagnostic accuracy compared to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), with better spatial resolution and quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow. Novel blood-based biomarkers beyond traditional cardiac enzymes are being investigated for CAD risk stratification and early detection, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), lipoprotein(a), and various genetic markers.

    Pharmacological management of CAD has expanded beyond traditional antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab) provide additional LDL cholesterol reduction for patients not achieving targets with statins alone. Newer P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor, prasugrel) offer more potent antiplatelet effects than clopidogrel for acute coronary syndrome patients. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, initially developed for diabetes, have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in patients with established cardiovascular disease, regardless of diabetes status.

    Interventional approaches have also advanced significantly. Drug-eluting stents have largely replaced bare-metal stents, with newer-generation devices having lower rates of restenosis and stent thrombosis. Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds, which provide temporary support and then dissolve over time, are being refined after initial challenges. For complex coronary lesions, specialized techniques such as rotational atherectomy, laser atherectomy, and intravascular lithotripsy can modify calcified plaque before stent implantation. Chronic total occlusion (CTO) intervention has become more successful with dedicated equipment and techniques.

    For patients with left main or multivessel disease, the choice between PCI and CABG remains individualized, informed by anatomical complexity (SYNTAX score), comorbidities, and patient preference. Hybrid revascularization, combining minimally invasive CABG for the left anterior descending artery with PCI for other vessels, offers a middle-ground approach for selected patients.

    Emerging research in CAD includes investigation of inflammation-targeting therapies, following the success of the CANTOS trial with canakinumab. Regenerative approaches using stem cells and gene therapy aim to promote angiogenesis and myocardial regeneration, though clinical translation remains challenging. Precision medicine approaches using genetic, molecular, and imaging biomarkers to guide personalized treatment strategies represent a promising frontier in CAD management.
